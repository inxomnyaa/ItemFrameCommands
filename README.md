# ItemFrameCommands
Run commands via item frames

## Features
This plugin allows you to add commands to item frames, which execute when a player hits the frame

It allows commands to be executed as player or as console.

## Usage
Usage is quite simple. First you place and item frame. Then you can add an item if you'd like, but that is not necessary, as it can be done later via a command.

Then you run `/frame addcmd`, which opens an UI, where you select the executor and command

Every time you run a `/frame` command, you must hit the item frame you want to edit afterwards, or execute `/frame abort` to cancel editing.

`/help frame [subcommand]` will show further help about the command usage & its subcommands

## Permissions
- All commands: `frame`
- subcommands: `frame.{subcommand}`

## TODO
- Enhance README with images & Poggit links & full command overview
